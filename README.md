# CVVR
2D Steady-State Heat Conduction (Jacobi Solver with Symmetry) Solves the Laplace equation for a half-domain plate using the Jacobi relaxation method with left–right symmetry. Snapshots are saved every 500 epochs and mirrored to form the full field. Visualization of the temperature evolution and steady state is created in ParaView (MP4/avi)
